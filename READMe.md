KushFree ðŸŸ¢
*KushFree* is a simple chatbox project created in response to the current drug emergency in Liberia, where the spread of kush (a dangerous synthetic drug) ha devastated many communities.
In 2025, Liberia officially declared drug abuse, especially kush, as a national emergency. Thousands of young people have been affected, with lives, families, and futures disrupted. Kush is cheap, addictive, and widely accessible, leading to rising health crises, homelessness, and loss of hope among many young Liberians.
KushFree is not a solution to the crisis on its own â€” but itâ€™s a small step toward support and awareness. 
It provides:
-A safe, anonymous space to chat and reflect.
-Simple coping suggestions (like breathing exercises or grounding).
-Crisis word detection with Liberian slangs(e.g., â€œI na wan live"(I want to die) that displays a support disclaimer and contact information.
-An open, editable tool that can grow with community input.
-This project is meant to raise awareness and show how technology can be used to support people battling addiction, even in low-resource settings like Liberia.
Note: KushFree is not a medical tool or a replacement for professional help. It is an educational and supportive app built by a student to highlight the crisis and inspire tech-driven solutions for communities in need.
