*KushFree*
KushFree is a simple chatbox project created in response to the current drug emergency in Liberia, where the spread of kush (a dangerous synthetic drug) has devastated many communities.

In 2025, Liberia officially declared drug abuse — especially kush — as a national emergency. Thousands of young people have been affected, with lives, families, and futures disrupted. Kush is cheap, addictive, and widely accessible, leading to rising health crises, homelessness, and loss of hope among many young Liberians.
*Why KushFree?*
KushFree is not a solution to the crisis on its own — but it’s a small step toward support and awareness.
It provides:
- A safe, anonymous space to chat and reflect
-Simple coping suggestions (like breathing exercises or grounding techniques)
- Crisis word detection with Liberian slang (e.g., “I na wan live” = “I want to die”) that triggers a support disclaimer and emergency contact information
  - An open, editable tool that can grow with community input
*Disclaimer*
KushFree is not a medical tool or a replacement for professional help.
It is an educational and supportive app, built by a student to highlight the crisis and inspire tech-driven solutions for communities in need — especially in low-resource settings like Liberia.
